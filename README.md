# Learning Three.js With Real World Challenges (that have already been solved)

This is a recreation of [New York Times: A 3-D View of a Chart That Predicts The Economic Future: The Yield Curve](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/19/upshot/3d-yield-curve-economic-growth.html?abt=0002&abg=1&_r=1) which was made by [Gregor Aisch](http://driven-by-data.net/) and [Amanda Cox](https://twitter.com/amandacox).

The code in this repo was written by Sue Lockwood, unless otherwise noted in the comments. :) 

The data used to create this graph was taken from the [U.S. Department of Treasury’s website](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2005).

I recreated this graph to learn more about working with Three.js. I, in no way, claim ownership of the original graph published by the NYT. They did a much better job, and I want to thank Gregor Aisch and Amanda Cox for doing such inspiring work. 

The code in this repo is part of a blog post on [Bocoup.com](http://bocoup.com).
